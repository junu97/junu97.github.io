#What is kernel? (In computer science)
kernel := Subset of operating system which is so essential and particularly important.
<br/>
It always operate on memory  

<br/> <br/>

#Why we divide kernel with every operating system?
Operating system is so important and essential for computer systems. 
So it looks like our memory must take operating system on memory every time (unless turn off the device).
<br/>
But the programs of operating system are so big and heavy, so that's hard to use other program on limited memory.
Therefore, we divide the most important and essential part of operating system's programs and took them on memory always.
